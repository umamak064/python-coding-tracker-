# Python Practice Tracker

A **Streamlit-based web app** to help you log, organize, and review your Python coding practice problems.  
Built for learners who want to stay consistent, track progress, and avoid forgetting old concepts.

---

##  Overview

The **Python Practice Tracker** lets you save every coding question you solve â€” along with your logic, what you learned, and even your code.  
It provides an interactive dashboard where you can:
- Add new practice entries
- Filter and review past problems
- Randomly pick older questions for spaced repetition
- Visualize your practice stats by topic

Everything is stored locally in a simple JSON file (`practice_log.json`) â€” no database setup needed.
